Note: No local targets specified, so a plain ghci will be started with no
      package hiding or package options.
      
      You are using snapshot: lts-18.22
      
      If you want to use package hiding and options, then you can try one of the
      following:
      
      * If you want to start a different project configuration
        than /Users/taylorwitherell/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml, then you can use
        stack init to create a new stack.yaml for the packages in the current
        directory. 
        
      * If you want to use the project configuration
        at /Users/taylorwitherell/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml, then you can add to its 'packages' field.
